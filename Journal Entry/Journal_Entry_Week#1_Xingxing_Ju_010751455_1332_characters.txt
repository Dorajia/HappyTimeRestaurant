1. The work I did last week:
 - Organize the team members meeting for three times and discussing the Team Project.
 - Decide the Project Topic as Happy Time Restaurant.
 - Finish the Requirement Analysis, write the Requirement Analysis Document.
 - Research the techniques which will be needed in this project, and deside the technique solution:
 	- For DB, we will use MongoDB + MySQL deployed on AWS;
 	- For Web Service, we will use NodeJs depployed on AWS;
 	- For Front End, we will use AngularJS deployed on Heroku.
 - Build the Github Repository and Waffle Board as a team leader.
 - Take the Front-End development task of User-Related Modules
 	- E.g, Sign Up, Sign In, Sign Out, View User Profile, Update User Profile, Comment Orders, etc. 
 	- Carry out the initial research and design.

2. The problems I encountered:
 - We didn't have enough knowledge for DB Scaling right now, so we haven't made decision about the DB Scaling Design.
 - Not familiar with Heroku.

3. The work I plan to do next week:
 - Continue the development of User-Related Modules front-end. If finished earlier, start testing and merging with backend team.
 - Continue the investigation of DB Scaling approaches.
 - Learn more about Heroku.
 - Support other team members.
